# About

Project developed in the 3rd year @Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest for "Compilation Techniques Fundamentals" subject.

# Task

Simulate a non-deterministic stack parser with lambda transitions.

[Program that simulates the operation of a non-deterministic stack translator with lambda-transitions. The program reads (from a file or console) the elements of a non-deterministic stack translator with lambda-transitions, including states, initial state, final states, input alphabet, output alphabet, stack alphabet, initial stack symbol, and transitions. The program allows the input of any number of strings over the input alphabet of the translator. For each such string, all corresponding outputs (strings over the output alphabet) are displayed. Please note that there may be 0, 1, or more outputs for the same input string.]

# Requirements

## Parser Input: (File/Console)

* States

* Initial state

* Final state

* Input alphabet

* Output alphabet

* Initial stack symbol

* Transitions


## Input (File/Console)

* A random number of strings over the input alphabet.

* For each input, all possible outputs (if any) over the output alphabet will be shown.
